The code is written to be compiled together with CDK version 1.4.x
CDK can be downloaded at http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdk/

usage on commandline:
java -jar filename

filename should be sdf or smiles file

the default code does not generate any output (simple text output is commented out in the code)
change it to output whatever results you'd like
